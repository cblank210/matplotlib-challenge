During the clinical trials for tumor reducing medications, the following observations have been made for treatment regimens:

1. 249 mice were observed with a nearly 50/50 distribution between male and female. These mice were provided different drug regimens in the aim of finding treatments which reduced tumor growth within the mice.

2. Two drug regimens in particular showed promise, Capomulin and Ramicane. They showed the lowest median tumor volume after treatment as well as the lowest variances. This could indicate more consistent results from treatments and are worth further investigation.

3. A single mouse (mouse b128) treated with Capomulin was selected to measure the results during treatment. During the course of 45 days a decrease in tumor volume from 45.00 mm3 to 38.98 mm3 was recorded. This downward trajectory indicates some potential success from the treatment.

4. A regression analysis of all Capomulin treatments showed a correlation coefficient of 0.84. This indicates a probable liklihood that tumor volume and weight relate to one another.

As testing continues, results of studies can narrow down the treatment regimens being considered and funded for research trials.
